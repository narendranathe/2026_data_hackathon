Large organizations will spend 10’s of millions in labor and system costs each year (BU’s each doing their own thing) while also having so much data sprawl that senior leadership teams struggle being data driven at the top. There is also a component of corporate alignment missing as well where data modeling and system design practices tend to follow org structure and culture - this is directly tied to data sprawl. However organizations can fix data sprawl by having a data-modeling-first strategy with senior leadership support (C suite and senior VP’s). This will help break down silos even when org structure naturally supports them (such as orgs built based on acquisitions).,United States / Canada

Often, requests come in as simple data movement tasks, but technical skills alone aren't enough to guarantee reliability. To build trust, engineers need domain training just as much as they need technical specs. Without understanding the business context, we can only check for generic errors (like null values or record count checks).

When we are trained in the domain, we can write business-specific Data Quality tests and robust reconciliation logic, ensuring that data doesn't just 'load' successfully, but actually matches the reality across source and target systems.
